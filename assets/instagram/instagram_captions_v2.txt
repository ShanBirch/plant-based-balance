*** POST 1: THE PROTEIN MYTH ***
[GRAPHIC: The Protein Myth - Animal vs Plant]

CAPTION:
"But where do you get your protein?" 🌱
If I had a dollar for every time I heard this...

Here is the truth about aging and protein:
Animal protein is anabolic (builds tissue), but it is also inflammatory. In perimenopause, inflammation is the enemy. It drives joint pain, brain fog, and cortisol spikes.

Plant protein is different. It comes packaged with:
✨ Fiber (to flush estrogen)
✨ Phytonutrients (to lower oxidation)
✨ Magnesium (to calm the nervous system)

You don't need *more* protein. You need *cleaner* protein.
Inside our 28-Day Protocol, we hit 80-100g of plant protein daily without a single piece of meat.

Result? Less inflammation. More energy.

*** POST 2: THE ENERGY CURVE (GRAPH) ***
[GRAPHIC: Daily Energy Levels Graph]

CAPTION:
Stop riding the glucose rollercoaster. 🎢
The red line on this graph? That's what happens when you cut carbs or rely on caffeine.
1. Immediate spike (Cortisol rush).
2. 3PM Crash (Adrenal fatigue).
3. Sugar cravings at night.

The green line? That's the Plant Protocol.
By pairing complex carbs (beans, quinoa, oats) with healthy fats, we create a slow-drip energy release that lasts all day.

No crash. No cravings. Just steady, calm focus.
If you're tired of being "Tired but Wired," it's time to stabilize your blood sugar.

*** POST 3: THE FIBER FIX (30g) ***
[GRAPHIC: 30g - The Fiber Fix]

CAPTION:
The most underrated hormone tool in your kitchen? Fiber. 🌿
Here is the science:
Your liver filters out used estrogen. But if you are constipated or low on fiber, that estrogen gets re-absorbed back into your bloodstream.

This creates "Estrogen Dominance" -> Bloating, Breast Tenderness, Mood Swings.

The fix? 30g of fiber per day.
Fiber acts like a sponge, binding to that excess estrogen and carrying it OUT of your body.

You can't get fiber from meat, dairy, or eggs. It only comes from plants.
Eat your medicine.

*** POST 4: THE QUOTE (MEAT VS SANITY) ***
[GRAPHIC: "I thought I needed meat... I needed plants for sanity."]

CAPTION:
A client said this to me last week, and it stuck. "I needed plants for sanity." 🧠

When we switch to a plant-forward diet, we aren't just changing our body composition. We are changing our neurochemistry.

Plants are the exclusive source of many precursors for Serotonin (the happy hormone) and GABA (the calm hormone).
By removing inflammatory triggers (dairy/meat) and flooding the body with minerals, the "mental noise" quiets down.

Anxiety drops. Sleep returns. The fog lifts.
It's not just food. It's mental health.

*** POST 5: 3AM WAKE UP CALL ***
[GRAPHIC: The 3AM Wake Up Call]

CAPTION:
Waking up at 3AM is not a bladder issue. It's a cortisol issue. 🕰️

Here is the cycle:
1. Your blood sugar drops too low while you sleep.
2. Your brain senses a "danger" (starvation).
3. Your adrenals fire a shot of Cortisol/Adrenaline to wake you up and release glucose.

Result? You wake up wide awake, heart racing, mind spinning.

The Fix:
We don't take sleeping pills. We stabilize blood sugar.
A small, plant-based fat/carb snack before bed (like our Adrenal Cocktail or a few cashews) keeps glucose stable all night.

Sleep through the night again. It changes everything.

*** POST 6: THE CORTISOL CURVE ***
[GRAPHIC: The Cortisol Curve - Stop The Spike]

CAPTION:
"Tired but Wired."
It’s the defining feeling of modern womanhood. You’re exhausted all day, but as soon as your head hits the pillow...ing! 💡

This is the Cortisol curve gone wrong (The Red Line).
Your rhythm is flipped. Your stress hormones are high at night when they should be low.

How do we fix it? We don't force it. We signal safety.
1. Morning sunlight.
2. Breakfast within 30 mins (Plant protein).
3. Somatic movement (not HIIT).

Our 28-Day Reset is designed to flatten this curve.
Stop forcing your body. Start supporting it.

*** POST 7: DAIRY VS ESTROGEN ***
[GRAPHIC: Dairy Milk (X) vs Almond Milk (Check)]

CAPTION:
"But I love cheese!" 🧀
I know. But does your body love it?

Dairy milk is designed to grow a baby calf into a 1,000lb cow. It is naturally full of mammalian estrogen and growth hormones (IGF-1).

When you add *cow* estrogen to a woman closer to menopause... you get fire. 🔥
Inflammation. Acne. Heaviness. Bloating.

Plants contain "Phytoestrogens" (like in soy and flax). These are completely different. They are adaptogenic—they help *balance* your levels, not spike them.

Swap the dairy. Watch the inflammation vanish.

*** POST 8: CALORIE MYTH ***
[GRAPHIC: 1200 Calories Is Not The Answer]

CAPTION:
Please stop eating 1,200 calories. ✋
If you are over 40, starvation is a stress signal.

When you undereat, your body thinks there is a famine. It responds by:
1. Slowing your thyroid (metabolism drops).
2. Hoarding belly fat (safety storage).
3. Breaking down muscle tissue.

To burn fat in perimenopause, you actually need to eat *enough* to convince your body it is safe to let go of the weight.

Eat dense, nutrient-rich plant foods. Fill your plate.
Nourish your body, don't punish it.
