[GRAPHIC: Running (Red/Spike) vs Walking (Green/Lower)]

CAPTION:
Are you "running" yourself into burnout? 🏃‍♀️🚫

We were taught that to lose weight, we need to run harder and move faster. But for women over 40, high-intensity cardio (HIIT or long runs) can actually BACKFIRE.

Why? Because it spikes Cortisol.
If your adrenal system is already stressed, adding exercise stress tells your body: "We are in danger! Store fat for survival!"
That fat goes directly to the midsection.

The switch?
Go for Strength Training + Walking.
It builds muscle (metabolism) without the cortisol spike.

Train smarter, not harder.

*** POST 10: THE INSULIN TRAP ***
[GRAPHIC: Circular Flow Chart - The Insulin Trap]

CAPTION:
The Vicious Cycle of Cravings. 🔄

Do you feel like you have "no willpower" around sugar? It’s not you. It’s your biochemistry.

The Trap:
1. Eat refined carbs/sugar.
2. Insulin spikes to clear it (and stores it as fat).
3. Blood sugar crashes 2 hours later.
4. Your brain screams "I NEED SUGAR" to survive the crash.

You can't "willpower" your way out of a biochemical crash.
You have to break the cycle.

How? Protein + Fiber at every meal.
This slows the absorption, flattens the curve, and stops the cravings before they start.

Break free. ⛓️‍💥

*** POST 11: YOUR LIVER & HORMONES ***
[GRAPHIC: Anatomy of Liver - The Estrogen Filter]

CAPTION:
Your liver does more than process wine. 🍷
It is the Master Filter for your hormones.

Once your body uses Estrogen, it sends it to the liver to be packaged up and thrown out (via the bowel).
But if your liver is sluggish (from toxins, alcohol, or processed food)... that "waste estrogen" doesn't get filtered.

It goes back into circulation.
This is "Estrogen Dominance." It looks like:
❌ Heavy periods
❌ Puffy skin/bloating
❌ Mood swings

Love your liver. Eat bitter greens, cruciferous veggies, and stay hydrated. 🥦

*** POST 12: ADRENAL CHECKLIST ***
[GRAPHIC: 3 Silent Signs of Adrenal Fatigue]

CAPTION:
Are you running on fumes? ⛽

Adrenal Fatigue (HPA Axis Dysfunction) is silent until it’s loud. It doesn't show up on a standard blood test, but it shows up in your life.

The 3 Big Signs:
1. "Tired but Wired." Exhausted all day, but wide awake at 10pm.
2. The 3PM Salt/Sugar Craving. Your adrenals need sodium and glucose to keep functioning.
3. The "Cortisol Tire." Weight that sits specifically around the belly button and won't budge.

If you checked all 3... your body is asking for safety, not a diet.
We fix this by nourishing the nervous system.

*** POST 13: THE 3AM SPIKE ***
[GRAPHIC: Clock at 3AM - Blood Sugar Crash Graph]

CAPTION:
Why do you wake up at 3:00 AM exactly? 🕒

It’s biology.
Around 3am, your liver often runs out of glycogen (stored energy).
If your blood sugar drops too low during deep sleep, your brain panics.

It signals the adrenals to release CORTISOL to "dump sugar" into the blood to save you.
That Cortisol spike wakes you up instantly. Heart racing. Mind worried.

The Fix? prevent the crash.
A small amount of resistant starch or healthy fat (like a few nuts) before bed can keep blood sugar stable all night.

Sleep is a skill. Let's master it. 💤
