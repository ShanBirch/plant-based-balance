        Hiring Manager<br>
        Jetts Fitness Gold Coast
    </div>

    <p><strong>RE: Application for Club Manager / Fitness Professional Opportunities</strong></p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

    <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the <strong>Club Manager</strong> position with Jetts Fitness Gold Coast. I am particularly interested in the opportunities at your <strong>Burleigh Heads</strong> or <strong>Mermaid Beach</strong> locations, but am open to vacancies across your network including Robina and Palm Beach.</p>

    <p>With over a decade of experience in the fitness industry, including six years founding and operating my own successful boutique studio and online coaching platform, I bring a unique blend of "owner mindset," operational expertise, and hands-on coaching passion that aligns perfectly with Jetts' mission to inspire better lives.</p>

    <p>While my primary goal is to bring my leadership experience to a <strong>Full-Time Club Manager</strong> role, I am also highly keen to apply for the <strong>Hybrid Personal Trainer / Club Assistant</strong> role. The opportunity to combine consistent income and operational duties with coaching is very appealing, and I believe my background makes me uniquely qualified to excel in this dual capacity immediately.</p>

    <p class="force-break"><strong>Why I am the ideal fit for the Jetts Team:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Proven Leadership (Club Manager Focus):</strong> As the owner of <em>Coco's Personal Training</em>, I managed the entire business lifecycle—driving membership growth, managing P&L, and ensuring industry-leading standards. I understand exactly what is required to "drive operational performance" and "own" a club's success.</li>
        <li><strong>Community & Culture:</strong> I firmly believe that a gym is only as strong as its community. I have years of experience building inclusive, high-energy cultures where members feel like family. I pride myself on being a leader who "leads from the front," equally comfortable mentoring a team as I am rolling up my sleeves to ensure the club is safe and welcoming.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Excellence (Hybrid/Assistant Focus):</strong> I am reliable, proactive, and have extensive customer service experience. I am comfortable with systems (Google Suite, CRM tools) and social media marketing, ensuring I can support the Club Manager effectively from day one.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am seeking a role where I can step into an established team and drive results without the need to build a new independent client base from scratch. I am actively looking for a long-term home where I can apply my extensive industry experience to help your club succeed.</p>

    <p>I hold a Bachelor of Exercise Science and all necessary certifications (Cert III/IV, First Aid, CPR). I would love the opportunity to discuss how my background as a gym owner and operator can translate into success for Jetts Gold Coast.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

    <div class="closing">
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p><strong>Shannon Birch</strong></p>
