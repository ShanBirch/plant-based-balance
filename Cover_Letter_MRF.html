        Hiring Team<br>
        MRF Coaching
    </div>

    <p><strong>RE: Application for Online Fitness Coach</strong></p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

    <p>I am writing to submit my application for the Online Fitness Coach position at MRF Coaching. As a Bachelor of Exercise Science graduate with over a decade of industry experience—ranging from owning a boutique studio to running my own systems-driven online coaching business—I resonate deeply with your evidence-based, results-driven approach.</p>

    <p>Please find below my responses to your key selection criteria:</p>

    <h3>1. Relevant Personal Training and Coaching Experience</h3>
    <p>My experience is dual-faceted, covering both in-person transformational training and high-touch online coaching.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Online Coaching Expertise:</strong> As the founder of <em>Plant Based Balance</em>, I built a fully remote coaching business where I manage clients via digital platforms (similar to Trainerize). I am well-versed in providing weekly video check-ins, adjusting macronutrient targets based on bio-feedback, and navigating clients through "real life" obstacles like social events and stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence-Based Programming:</strong> With a background in Exercise Science, my programming is strictly evidence-based. I have extensive experience designing hypertrophy and body recomposition phases, ensuring clients achieve sustainable results without "bro-science."</li>
        <li><strong>Client Relationship Management:</strong> Whether running my studio (<em>Coco's Personal Training</em>) or coaching online, my retention strategy has always been built on empathy and connection. I understand that the psychological aspect of coaching—building confidence and mindset—is just as important as the physical protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="force-break">2. Why This Role Appeals to Me</h3>
    <p>After years of wearing every hat as a business owner—from marketing and sales to tech support—I am seeking a role where I can focus purely on what I do best: <strong>coaching</strong>. I am eager to join a thriving, established team like MRF Coaching where the systems and structures are already in place, allowing me to dedicate my energy to client results rather than business administration.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I admire MRF's commitment to "no ego" and "evidenced-based" results. High-integrity coaching culture is rare, and I want to be part of a team that values professional excellence and genuine client care over toxic gym tropes.</p>

    <p class="force-break"></p>

    <h3>3. Why I Am a Suitable Candidate</h3>
    <p>I believe I offer the perfect balance of experience and "coachability":</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Systems-Oriented & Tech-Savvy:</strong> I love structure. I have personally built automation workflows (using Zapier/Webhooks) for my own business, so I will adapt to MRF's existing frameworks and software ecosystem seamlessly. You won't need to teach me how to be an online coach; just how to be an <em>MRF</em> coach.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote-Ready Professional:</strong> I have been working 100% remotely since transitioning my business online. I am disciplined, responsive, and understand the nuances of building rapport through a screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Qualified & Humble:</strong> despite my experience as a business owner, I approach every new environment with a "learning mindset." I am eager to learn the specific MRF methodology and contribute to the team's success without ego.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in evidence-based coaching and client management can contribute to the MRF team.</p>

    <div class="closing">
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p><strong>Shannon Birch</strong></p>
