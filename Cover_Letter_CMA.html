        Hiring Team<br>
        Cut Method Academy / FF40
    </div>

    <p><strong>RE: Application for Online Fitness Coach (FF40)</strong></p>

    <p>Dear FF40 Hiring Team,</p>

    <p>I read your job description with absolute excitement because it describes—almost exactly—the niche I have dedicated the last several years of my career to building. As an experienced online coach who specializes in women's hormonal health, perimenopause support, and metabolic restoration, I am not just looking for "a job"; I am looking for a team that shares my mission to help women over 40 thrive without burnout or extremes.</p>

    <p><strong>Addressing Your Specific Requirements:</strong></p>

    <h3>Experience with Women Over 40 & Hormonal Health</h3>
    <p>This is my primary area of expertise. As the founder of <em>Plant Based Balance</em>, I have developed specific protocols for <strong>Cortisol Management</strong> and <strong>Estrogen Regulation</strong>. I understand deeply that "eat less, move more" stops working for women in this demographic. My coaching methodology focuses on reverse dieting to repair metabolic adaption, gut health optimization, and stress management as the foundation for sustainable fat loss.</p>

    <h3>Online Coaching Proficiency (Trainerize & Systems)</h3>
    <p>I have been an online coach for over 3 years (and a business owner for 6+). I am an advanced user of <strong>Trainerize</strong>, having built my own custom automations to streamline client onboarding and compliance. I am comfortable managing high client volumes (40-50+) while maintaining "high touch" support through weekly video check-ins and responsive messaging.</p>

    <p class="force-break"></p>

    <h3>Application Question Responses</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Have you coached women over 40 with hormonal/metabolic challenges?</strong> YES. This is my exact niche. I have successfully coached hundreds of women through perimenopause, specifically addressing insulin resistance, adrenal fatigue, and menopausal weight gain.</li>  
        <li><strong>Have you coached 40 or more clients at the same time?</strong> YES. In my own business, I have managed rosters exceeding this volume, utilizing systems to ensure every client feels heard and supported.</li>
        <li><strong>Trainerize Experience?</strong> YES. It is my daily operating system. I also use MyFitnessPal (MFP) for nutritional auditing.</li>
        <li><strong>ABN & Subcontractor Status?</strong> Yes, I have a valid ABN and am fully set up to invoice as an independent contractor immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Professional Focus?</strong> Yes, online coaching is my 100% full-time professional focus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why I Want This Role</h3>
    <p>I am a "go-getter" who loves the craft of coaching but prefers the structure of an established team. I want to leverage my deep experience with your target demographic to deliver undeniable results for FF40 clients, while benefiting from the mentorship and culture of a fast-growing company.</p>

    <p>I am ready to hit the ground running with no training wheels required. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience aligns with the FF40 mission.</p>

    <div class="closing">
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p><strong>Shannon Birch</strong></p>
