Headline: Why traditional dieting is a trap for women over 40. 🛑

If you’ve been eating less and exercising more, but the scale won’t budge—you don’t have a willpower problem. You have a physiological signal problem.

As our biology shifts, things like chronic stress and hormonal fluctuations (dropping estrogen + spiking cortisol) tell your body to enter "Metabolic Storage Mode." In this state, 1,200 calories and high-intensity cardio don't burn fat—they just increase inflammation and fatigue.

The 28-Day Hormonal Reset is different. We don’t guess. We use AI Biometrics and plant-based science to "flip the switch" from storage back to fuel.

✨ Phase 1: The Flush. Clear the hormonal backlog and lower the adrenal load.
✨ Phase 2: Stabilize. Lock in your new metabolic set-point.

Stop fighting your biology. Start working with it. 🌿
